The course's purpose was to get to know the command-line environment and it teached the basic use of command-line tools, with an emphasis on how it can be utilized for the purposes of linguistics.

The course was divided into 7 weeks (+ a final assignment) and each week had its own theme and assignments on the topic of the week.
